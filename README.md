# djangoAddress
Project for LSA employment

This project was created with python version 3.10.4  
and django version 4.0.4  

I used the default settings from the django project creation:  
SQLite database  
after using runserver command, use localhost:8000/address to see the app running  

Summary Info:  
See api.md for a summary of the api defined in address/urls.py  

Assumptions:  
I assumed that django projects always trigger html requests through html forms,  
because that's how the official tutorial did it.  
I also assumed that user stories and features of convenience were more valuable than visual styling.  

Next steps:  
See stretchGoals.txt for a list of things I would do if I continued investing in this project
